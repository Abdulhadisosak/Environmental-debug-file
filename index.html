                    <h1>Why To Save Earth And It's Environment</h1>
                    <h3 class="contents" >Environmental awareness means exactly what you may think: an awareness around the natural environment and the choices that either promote its well-being or cause it more harm. It is also the awareness that the earth is in need of protection for its survival. Along with this, the term “environmentalism” is an ideology that humans are responsible to protect and preserve the environment from human-caused afflictions. As previously stated, human-made choices are the number one reason why the planet is becoming sicker every day. Environmentalism on a large scale is one of the best ways to combat the devastating consequences of these human decisions and help the planet’s health take a complete 180 degree in the other direction. 
                    </h3>
                    <h1>major environmental environment problems</h1>
                    <h3 id="EnvironmentalIsuues" class="contents">Some environmental life species require substantial areas to help provide food, living space, and other different assets. These creatures are called area specific.
                        At the point when the biome is divided, the vast patches of living space don’t exist anymore. It becomes more troublesome for the wildlife to get the assets they need in order to survive. The environment goes on, even though the animals and plant life are not there to help sustain it properly</h3>
